5 Primitive Data Types
1. Numbers
2. Strings (basically text inside of quotes)
3. Booleans (True or false)
4 and 5. Null and Undefined (These are values)

Numbers
JS can do basic arithmetic (+,-,x,/)
Modulo is represented by %
ex) 10%3 is 10 mod 3 or 1

Strings
Can use double (") or single (') quotes
Can add strings together
Use the backslash to escape the strings
.length will count how many characters are in the string
[] will return a certain charcacter from a strings

Variables
A container to hold stuff or data for later recall
Use var name of variable space = value;
Use camelCase naming for variables (second word is capitalized while first word is lower case)
snake_case (join words with underscore)
dash-case (join words with dash)

Null and Undefined
Undefined means that nothing was assigned to the variable
Null means we want nothing assigned to it
