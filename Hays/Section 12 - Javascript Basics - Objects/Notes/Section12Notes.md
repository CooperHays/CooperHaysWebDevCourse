Objects:
  A data structure
  Use Curly braces{
    property: value,
  }
  Objects have no order

Retrieve objects out of an object using 2 methods:
  1. name of object["key"]; - Similar to calling an item out of an array
    Can look up using a variable name
  2. dot notation: nameofobject.key
    Key cannot start with a number or has a space in it

To update a property, you reassign it with =
  Example:  person.city = "London";

In other languages, an object is called a dictionary

JS Methods:
  A function that is a property inside of an object
  Add a method using add:
  This will prevent namespace collisions
