Note for Brett - Using Chrome as our testing browser is important to use the built-in dev tools.  We are using Atom instead of Sublime Text because the full version and features are all free and awesome.

Brett-here is a list of Atom packages/themes I would like you to install.  File-->Settings and find your way if you can :)

Packages:
1.  Emmet
2.  atom-ternjs
3.  color-picker
4.  pigments
5.  atom-terminal-panel

Themes: up to you but I like these:

UI Theme: atom-material-ui
Syntax Theme: atom-material-syntax


Brett Notes:
I'm so ready to start this!
