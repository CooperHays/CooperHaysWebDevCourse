JS Conditionals:
  How we add logic to our code
  Remember the keyword:
    if
    else if (a secondary condition)
    else (whatever else will run only after first 2 are false)

Number() will convert a string to a Number

Loops:
  DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
  While Loop - while(some condition) {
    //run some code
  } - This is a recursive function mentality where you start from an intial value and repeat until a condition is no longer satisfied

  count++ means add 1 to the variable count
  count+=2 means add 2 to the variable count
