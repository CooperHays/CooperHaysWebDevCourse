This section has some notes on communication tools:

which we can access with our Github accounts.

Also viewed the course syllabus.

Note for Brett - Using Chrome as our testing browser is important to use the built-in dev tools.  We are using Atom instead of Sublime Text because the full version and features are all free and awesome.
